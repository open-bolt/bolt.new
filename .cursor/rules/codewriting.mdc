## **Code-Specific Cursor Rules**
These rules apply only to code files.

### **Code Review**
- Check for type safety.  
- Verify error handling.  
- Ensure code follows project patterns.  
- Look for performance implications.  
- Validate accessibility standards.  

### **Code Refactoring**
- Maintain backward compatibility.  
- Update tests alongside changes.  
- Document breaking changes.  
- Follow the project's type system.  
- Keep components modular and reusable.  

### **Code Quality & Clean Code Guidelines**
- **Verify Information:** No assumptionsâ€”verify all information before presenting it.  
- **Meaningful Changes:** Make changes file by file, provide all edits in one chunk.  
- **Code Readability:** Use meaningful names, replace hard-coded values with constants, and maintain structure.  
- **Smart Comments:** Explain *why*, not *what*. Document APIs, complex algorithms, and side effects.  
- **Maintainability & Best Practices:** Follow SRP, DRY, and encapsulation principles. Continuously refactor.  

### **Testing & Version Control**
- Write tests before fixing bugs, covering edge cases.  
- Keep tests readable and maintainable.  
- Use clear commit messages, small focused commits, and meaningful branch names.  

### **Interaction & Process**
- No apologies.  
- No summaries of changes made.  
- No unnecessary confirmations.  
- Always provide real file links, not placeholders.
